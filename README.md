The IPL Dashboard is a user-friendly website designed exclusively for cricket enthusiasts. 
It offers a seamless and informative experience during the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket season in 2023.

Key Features:
1.Team Info
2.venue Info
3.Past Matches Results Info

Technologies Used:
React: The project is built using React, a powerful technology for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
HTML: HTML is used to structure web pages, ensuring a well-organized and accessible interface.
CSS: CSS is employed for styling, enhancing the website's appearance and user experience.

Responsive Design: The project is designed with responsiveness in mind, utilizing media queries and flexbox for adaptive layouts across different devices and screen sizes.
Since my major focus was building the frontend part of the application, I integrated mock APIs for displaying data.
I followed clean code guidelines by maintaining a consistent folder structure and used meaningful naming conventions, 
such as prefixing event handlers with on and creating reusable components throughout the application. 

Future Plans:
The IPL Dashboard project holds potential for further development and enhancement. Future plans may involve integrating real APIs for live data, adding new features, and optimizing the user experience based on user feedback and requirements.
